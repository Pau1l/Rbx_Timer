[Get the model here](https://www.roblox.com/library/14822550176/Timer-Module)

## Setting up the Timer:
```lua
-- Make sure to require the Timer from a correct path:

local RepStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
local Timer = require(RepStorage:WaitForChild("Timer")).new()

```

## This module can:

* Start the timer!
* Stop the timer!

This is mostly a base timer 'skeleton' so feel free to use and modify it however you want to.
